# Array Data Structure

An array is a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations.
Arrays work on an index system starting from `0` to `(n-1)`, where n is the size of the array.

## Types of Array

### One-dimensional Array
In a one-dimensional array the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations where each element is accessed by using a single index value. It is a linear data structure storing all the elements in sequence.

### Two-dimensional Array
In types of arrays, a two dimensional array is a tabular representation of data where elements are stored in rows and columns. A two dimensional array is actually a collection of M X N elements which has M rows and N columns.  To access any element in a two-dimensional array two subscripts are required for defining position of an element in a specific row and column. The first index is for row number and second is for column index.

### Three-dimensional Array
In types of arrays, a three-dimensional array is an extension to the two dimensional array with addition of depth. It can be seen as a cube that has rows, columns and depth as third dimension. To access any element in a three-dimensional array three subscripts are required for position of element in a specific row, column and depth. The first index is for depth (dimension or layer), second is for row index and third is for column.
