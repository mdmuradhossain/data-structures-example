# Tree Data Structure

The tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure and comprises a collection of entities known as nodes. It connects each node in the tree data structure using "edges”, both directed and undirected.

The image below represents the tree data structure. The blue-colored circles depict the nodes of the tree and the black lines connecting each node with another are called edges.

## Tree Applications
- Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not.
- Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.
- A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information.
- Most popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees, which are variants of the tree structure we learned above to store their data
- Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.
